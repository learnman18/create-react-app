    after increment if we click on decrement for the first time it will increment the number instead of decreasing it.

    increment = () => {
        this.setState({page: this.state +1})
            console.log("incerement" , this.state.page) 
    }
    decrement = () => {
        this.setState({page: this.state - 1})
            console.log("incerement" , this.state.page) 
    }

    The issue you're facing might be related to the asynchronous nature of setState in React. 
    When you call setState, React does not immediately update the state. Instead, it schedules an update, 
    and the state may not be updated right away.

    Here's an updated version of your code that addresses this issue by using the callback form of setState,
    which ensures that the state is updated based on the previous state:

     increment = () => {
        this.setState((prevState)=> ({
            page: prevState.page +1
        }),() => {
            console.log("incerement" , this.state.page)
        });
    }
  
    decrement = () => {
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
        page: prevState.page - 1,
        }), () => {
        console.log("decrement ", this.state.page);
        });
    };
