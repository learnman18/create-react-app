<li className="nav-item">
	<NavLink className="nav-link" style={({ isActive }) => ({
		color: isActive ? "red" : "inherit",
	})} to='/services' >Services</NavLink>
</li>

that's how we use style inline css using react's ternary operator.
isActive is predefined <NavLink> method

-------------------

className={({ isActive, isPending }) =>
	[
	isPending ? "pending" : "",
	isActive ? "active" : ""
	]
} 

here we have two ternary conditon's so we are keeping it in array

in this we can use active class and add whatever css we want.

using ternary operator in inline className

but we don't need to use any of these - if we are using <NavLink> it automatically applies,
.active class and we just need to add css in that class.
