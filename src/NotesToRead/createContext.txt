useState()

createContext() - 
If we want to pass some data from one parent comp to their child comp when we have multiple child comp and we want only one particluar 
child comp to access the data.

App.js
compA.js
compB.js
CompC.js

I want the data to share the data with only compC.js
It needs three things to share the data.
1. createContext
2. Provider - the one who will provide the data
3. consumer - the one who will access the data

App.js

const firstName = createContext();
inside - return (
<>
	<firstName.Provider value={"Manish"}>
		//the first child from where we are accessing the compC will be here so here it is 
		<compA>
	</firstName.Provider>
</>
)
if we want to transfer the data we need to export it.

export default App.js
export {firstName};

compC.js

and when we are accessing, the consumer only understands functions so we can only use function

import firstName;

<firstName.Consumer>{(fname)=>{
	<h1>Hello this is  {fname}</h1>
}}</firstName.Consumer>


Output - Hello this is Manish
